**Maji Ndogo Water Access – Power BI Analysis**

This repository contains a comprehensive Power BI project analyzing water accessibility challenges in Maji Ndogo, a region experiencing significant water shortages. The goal of the project was to deliver actionable insights to support decision-makers in improving water access, prioritizing interventions, and allocating budget effectively.

**📊 Project Overview**

Maji Ndogo faces increasing pressure on its water infrastructure due to population growth, limited clean water sources, long queue times, and failing taps. This analysis evaluates:

Population access to basic water services

Distribution of rural vs. urban water sources

Type and frequency of required improvements

Provincial disparities in cost and accessibility

Budget allocation and projected impact once improvements are completed

The insights support optimising infrastructure investment and improving water service delivery across the region.

**🧠 Key Insights Generated**
✔️ 1. Only 34% of the population currently has access to basic water services

The dashboard highlights low baseline access and identifies key drivers of water insecurity, especially in rural communities.

✔️ 2. Improvements planned could raise basic access by 64%

Data modelling shows a significant increase in water access once the proposed upgrades are completed.

✔️ 3. Major upgrades are needed for public/shared taps

Shared taps serve the majority of people, especially in rural areas, and require the highest number of interventions.

✔️ 4. Sokoto and Kilimani account for the highest total improvement costs

Both provinces consume over £40M each, driven by extensive drilling and installation needs.

✔️ 5. Drilling wells and installing multiple taps are the most expensive improvements

Rural areas require more intensive solutions, which dramatically increases costs compared to urban improvements.

**📈 Key KPIs in the Report**
KPI	Description
34%	Current % population with basic water access
+64% improvement	Projected % increase once upgrades are completed
$146.7M Total Budget	Total projected spend on water infrastructure
Improvement counts	Number and type of interventions required
Cost by province	Total cost of improvements by region

**🔍 Analysis Highlights**
Water Access Gaps:
Rural residents face the most severe shortages, with shared taps and wells requiring major infrastructure improvements.

Budget Prioritisation:
The analysis informs where investment will have the highest impact and which provinces need accelerated intervention.

Projected Outcomes:
With a budget of ~$147M, the model predicts a significant improvement in water access — particularly if efforts focus on shared taps and rural communities.
